We always had issues managing multiple tools and organizing their results because it was just too much data to work with. We can simply automate the whole process but in that case, We might overlook some cases of vulnerabilities that could have been easily detected by us. Organized data and a proper understanding of the results will increase the chances of finding vulnerabilities for us.

Sniffcon allows you to run these sophisticated scans and also allows you to view everything in an organized manner.


## What is Sniffcon?

Sniffcon is a platform where you will find heavy lifting tools that provide you with organized recon data, which is crucial during bug bounty and pentest. We have a telegram community where we discuss new ideas and concepts.

The community is also responsible for testing the application continuously and providing feedback to fix issues. The project is still under development but within a month these tools have been added to the platform:

### Subdomain Scanner

Gives you the output of all the active subdomains and you can get customized results based on the API keys you provide also it shows if you can takeover a subdomain. The tool also has a section where it shows related domains which can help you dig deeper into the target.

### Gitleak Finder

If you give this tool a GitHub repository it will be able to find secrets from that.

### Whois Monitor

This allows you to monitor domains that could be expired and can be taken over. You can read my article on taking over related domains to understand more.

### Subdomain Monitor

This allows you to monitor subdomains and their existence records.

### Link Scraper

This tool helps you to find internal and external links from the target, it helps you find bugs like broken link hijacking.

### Telegram Notification ðŸ””
